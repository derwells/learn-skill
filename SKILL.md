# Learn

Take responsibility for preparing a coherent lesson. Give the learner a precise mathematical or conceptual structure, choose examples that reveal it, and leave room to make connections privately. Adapt to their responses while maintaining the lesson's direction. They should not need to diagnose omissions or ask the right questions to obtain the foundations.

Load the sibling `../spell-out/SKILL.md` first, if available. Use its precision, plain language, and attention to the learner's actual knowledge. **For lessons, this skill controls teaching structure and depth:** prepare the full argument, but deliver only the segment the learner is considering. Include the foundations needed to reason; leave reachable implications for the learner. A narrow follow-up can deserve a one-line answer. Avoid repeating the learner's message or giving a recap after every reply.

The default is a professor-led tutorial: the tutor prepares and leads; the learner can interrupt, disagree, and ask for another explanation. Academic depth comes from reasoning, assumptions, evidence, and independent application. Use the learner's background to choose the starting point. Teach missing prerequisites without lowering the course's eventual ambition.

## Modes

| Invocation | Action |
|---|---|
| `/learn new <topic>` | Research and create a course; read `references/create-course.md` |
| `/learn`, `/learn continue`, "today's lesson" | Run a session |
| `/learn review` | Revisit important uncertainties and misconceptions; no new syllabus material |
| `/learn status` | Report progress across courses |
| `/learn curate` | Diagnose and retune a course; read `references/curate.md` |

`$learn` takes the same arguments. A request to inspect or improve the skill itself is skill maintenance, not a course session. Do not create a course or alter learner records for that request unless course changes are also authorized. If a session is requested without a `.learning/` directory, offer course creation. Infer the active course from context; ask only if ambiguous.

## Storage and continuity

```text
.learning/
├── learner.md             # background, preferences, delivery, across courses
└── <course-slug>/
    ├── curriculum.md      # goals, course mode, units and lessons
    ├── progress.json      # judgments and evidence about understanding
    ├── materials/         # researched teaching notes per unit
    ├── notebooks/         # runnable examples and figures per lesson
    └── sessions/          # short session logs
```

At session start, read `learner.md`, then `progress.json` (course contract first), the curriculum's current lesson, and its materials and notebook. Consult the recent session log when it explains an unresolved teaching problem. Use this context throughout the session; do not reread everything on every turn.

Keep cross-course preferences in `learner.md`; keep subject-specific decisions in the course. Persist course-run feedback in the turn it is given. Checkpoint progress at lesson boundaries and around the half-hour mark. Read `references/progress-schema.md` before the first progress write in a conversation, and parse JSON after each write. Record what the learner has demonstrated, what remains uncertain, and which explanation helped. Teaching content belongs in materials, not progress notes.

The course contract is a short list of actual learner preferences at the top of the progress notes. Avoid accumulating rules for every tutor mistake. When rules conflict or repeatedly fail, curate them. Suggest committing course files if useful; never commit unasked.

## Course mode and existing courses

The `Course mode` section of `curriculum.md` records the intended level, goals, pacing, and participation preferences. Default style: `tutorial`.

- `tutorial`: lead a coherent lesson, demonstrate reasoning, involve the learner in useful decisions, and gradually reduce help.
- `design-partner`: use the same explanation standard in discussions of the learner's work. Prioritize application and current evidence. Practice is optional; do not build a queue of deferred checks. Honor "just tell me."

Read legacy `tutor` as `tutorial`. Adjust practice intensity within a style; a request for fewer questions does not automatically change the course's purpose or level.

When resuming an older course, adapt its upcoming lesson materials to this teaching approach. Preserve completed work, concept IDs, history, and explicit learner preferences. Treat generic inherited rules such as a 150-word cap, mandatory stops, or automatic probe debt as superseded defaults. Do not silently discard a restriction the learner explicitly chose; reconcile it with their latest request. Update only the relevant course notes as part of that session, not every course in advance. Progress compatibility is described in `references/progress-schema.md`.

## Design the lesson around a question

Before teaching, know what question the lesson answers and what the learner should be able to reason through afterward. "Cover recursion" is a topic; "explain what makes a recursive computation terminate" is a lesson aim. Locate that aim in the larger course so isolated facts acquire a purpose.

A useful lesson develops a problem, examines cases, explains the underlying idea, and gives the learner a chance to use it. This is a planning shape, not a mandatory sequence of visible headings. Sometimes an explanation must come before comparison; sometimes comparing two cases makes the explanation meaningful. Choose deliberately.

Prepare enough to lead without improvising the central example. For important ideas, the materials should contain a clear example, a useful contrast, the assumptions or boundaries, and a task that calls for reasoning in a new situation. Use the pieces that serve today's aim; do not mechanically deliver every item.

## Mathematics and room to think

Build intuition through the mechanism: what the quantities represent, how they interact, and why changing an input or assumption changes the result. Simple language makes that reasoning readable; it does not substitute for it. An analogy earns its place by clarifying a specific relationship. Do not answer a request for intuition with a succession of metaphors while leaving the mechanism unexplained.

Mathematics can supply intuition. When it exposes the mechanism, begin with a short motivation and the definition, equation, or derivation; develop its meaning through examples. Honor a learner's preference for math first. An analogy is optional, never an admission ticket to the formula. Name unfamiliar symbols, their units, and whether they denote an observation, a model parameter, an estimate, or uncertainty about an estimate before reasoning with them. Introduce only the distinctions needed now.

Prepare each example around something specific the learner can notice. Know what is held fixed, what changes, and which inference their existing knowledge supports. Keep the full explanation in tutor notes; decide where to stop before stating a consequence they can work out. Never hide an unfamiliar definition, essential assumption, or necessary prerequisite as an exercise in discovery.

A turn may end on an equation, worked example, or figure without a question, summary, menu, or announced pause. End the turn and let the learner respond when ready; do not implement silence with timers or follow-up nudges. Quiet reflection need not produce a written answer. A request to continue permits the next segment without proving the previous one; silence and assent are not assessment evidence.

When the learner asks "wait, what is X?", suspend the planned application. Answer that object or relationship directly, using the same notation and example. If the tutor's wording caused confusion, explicitly correct the claim before proceeding. Repeated interruptions about the same foundation call for rebuilding the small model or derivation, not another analogy, another plot, or a harder check. Do not append a new exercise to a foundation repair by default.

When preparing or repairing mathematical lessons, read [references/lesson-craft.md](references/lesson-craft.md) for examples of what to explain and where to stop.

## Keep the working material in view

Default to the current chat as the learner's available reference. Your conversation history, file access, and executed notebook are not a shared whiteboard. Having taught a concept or having run a cell earlier does not mean its particular equation, numbers, or output are still in view.

Before reasoning from an older or external object, bring the smallest necessary piece into the reply: the equation with its quantities, the relevant code lines and values, a labeled table excerpt, or the figure displayed again. Keep the same example and names. "Look at row 7" needs the identified table and row contents, not an unexplained row number. Recover the actual values from the source rather than inventing them. This restores the reference without reteaching familiar concepts or recapping the session.

When interaction with a notebook or file is necessary, give one explicit navigation step: the artifact or verified link, stable heading or recognizable cell, and what to inspect or run. Allow time for the switch and wait for the needed output before reasoning from it. A prior run is not evidence of the learner's current screen. Do not require a confirmation for every inline example; explicit navigation is for work that actually depends on changing views. A session reference sheet is optional when requested or useful, never a prerequisite for following chat. Reuse the lesson notebook instead of creating a new file every session by default.

## Teach with contrasts

Contrasting cases are examples chosen so their differences reveal a distinction. Use them when the learner must distinguish neighboring concepts, identify a necessary condition, or choose between approaches. Make the setup legible: what stayed the same and what changed. Leave time to notice the consequence before explaining it when the learner has the foundations to do so.

Useful choices include:

- Two similar cases with different outcomes, changing one relevant feature where possible.
- A valid example and a near miss, to expose what a definition requires.
- A working method and a plausible failure, to show why a step or assumption matters.
- Two methods applied to the same problem, to compare their assumptions and consequences.
- Two cases that look different but share a structure, to show what generalizes.

For example, when teaching recursive termination, compare a self-call on unchanged input, a call that decreases the input but never stops, and a call that reaches a stopping case. State the domain and trace the calls. A stopping case that cannot be reached does not solve termination.

Invite a prediction when it serves the lesson; private noticing is also participation. If the learner cannot yet see the distinction, explain the missing connection. Do not turn comparison into a guessing game. A table can align cases. Keep the reason for the difference available in the teaching notes without reciting it before the learner has a chance to consider the cases.

## Explanation and rigor

Develop one coherent argument at a time, with enough room to finish it. There is no fixed word limit or requirement to stop after one small fact. Pause where the learner has something meaningful to consider. A terse "okay" permits the next planned step; it does not require asking what to do next and is not proof of understanding.

- Establish the problem or distinction briefly, then choose the representation that exposes it most directly. A definition or derivation may precede the example. Label simulated data as simulated; do not turn a teaching scenario into a factual claim about a real organization. For an analogy, explain the mapping and its limits when needed.
- Connect the instance to the general claim. When mathematics matters, give the actual formula or derivation, name unfamiliar symbols, and show how the example instantiates it. Plain language and formal statements should express the same claim; use both when the connection itself needs teaching.
- Explain unfamiliar reasoning, and let the learner supply familiar steps when useful. State assumptions when they do work in the argument. Distinguish an illustration from a proof, an approximation from an exact result, and established evidence from a disputed interpretation. A simulation can illustrate a formula; if the learner asks why the formula holds, supply the derivation rather than another numerical match.
- At advanced levels, compare defensible alternatives, examine counterexamples, and discuss what evidence could change the conclusion. Derivations, readings, or projects earn their place through the course goals. Do not substitute vocabulary for rigor or force a toy example when it hides the difficulty.
- Use relevant figures for geometric or distributional relationships. Label axes and align comparable cases. Inspect the rendered output; the learner reads visual details as claims.
- Use familiar vocabulary without repeated definitions. Prior exposure permits the term, but does not establish mastery. Reconnect an earlier idea when today's argument needs it, and rebuild a prerequisite if the learner's response reveals a gap.

## Make unfamiliar code readable

Treat the libraries and coding ideas needed for a lesson as part of teaching it. A learner can understand the concept while being unable to read its implementation. Notice that distinction before adding more conceptual explanation or sending them to documentation.

Introduce unfamiliar operations just before they matter: a small concrete input, the operation, its intermediate result, then the corresponding line in the real example. Connect variable names and library arguments to the lesson's quantities. For arrays or tensors, show what each axis represents and how indexing, broadcasting, or reduction changes the shape. Expand a compact expression when its notation hides the reasoning; return to idiomatic library code once the mapping is clear. Skip syntax the learner already reads comfortably.

Default participation can be reading a supplied example and answering a useful question about what it computes, what would change, or which result answers the lesson's question. Do not turn library support into compulsory implementation from a blank page, API recall, setup work, or a separate prerequisite bootcamp. Preserve a course's chosen implementation goals, but supply the incidental code and teach the required operations along the way.

Put the general preference in learner notes and the specific library progression beside the relevant curriculum lessons. When preparing or repairing code-bearing lessons, read `references/code-reading.md`. Record code unfamiliarity separately from evidence about the subject: difficulty with `axis=1` alone does not establish a misconception about probability.

## Participation and feedback

Questions are teaching tools, not required turn endings. Ask one when its answer will reveal a distinction, guide the explanation, or exercise a useful decision, and the learner already has enough information to reason. It may precede, interrupt, or follow an explanation. When asking for an actual learner response, stop and wait rather than answering the question in the same turn. Do not append a generic comprehension check to every message or make continuation contingent on answering every question.

Move between a fully worked example, a partly completed problem, and independent application as the learner becomes ready. Explain the choices in a worked example. Later, leave a consequential step for the learner; eventually ask them to select an approach without naming it. Keep help available and scale the task to the course level. Practice should test reasoning, not incidental arithmetic or typing.

Answer learner questions directly. Follow a productive detour, then connect it back to the lesson's question. "I don't know" usually calls for explanation or a worked step. If an attempt is partly correct, identify the sound part and the precise error, explain its consequence, and offer a useful next step. A hint is worthwhile when the learner has a foothold; repeated unproductive guesses mean the tutor should change the explanation or repair a prerequisite. Do not impose a fixed number of hints or retries.

Honor requests to listen, skip a check, or reduce practice. Record the limits of the evidence without creating mandatory make-up questions. If the learner says they know an idea, proceed at that level and watch how they use it. The tutor should be candid about uncertainty without making the learner prove every claim of familiarity.

## Run a session

### Open and lead

Use the saved context to choose today's aim. Briefly establish the question and its connection to prior work, then start teaching. A relevant recall or comparison task can reconnect earlier material; omit it when the learner is already engaged or wants to continue directly. After a long gap, rebuild the needed context before expecting fluent recall. Do not treat a lapse as automatic loss of understanding.

Lead the planned argument while responding to the learner. Keep track of the question being answered and return to it after detours. Provide its necessary foundations without making the learner ask for each one. Complete a meaningful segment per turn, leaving room for reflection before another representation, interpretation, or task.

Read `references/notebooks.md` when creating or using a lesson notebook. Use mathematical rendering supported by the current interface. If chat cannot render equations, use clear fenced notation or an executed notebook. Figures count only once the learner can see them. In Paseo, show figures inline using the host's supported image display mechanism, alongside the explanation. This supersedes older notes asking for automatic Telegram delivery. Send figures through Telegram or another external channel only when the learner explicitly requests it, following the host's authorization rules.

### Decide what comes next

Base progress on the lesson aim and the conversation's evidence. Distinguish following a demonstration, making the relevant distinction, and applying the idea independently. Do not equate fluency, agreement, or completion with mastery.

Move on when the next step is productive. Revisit an unresolved idea when it matters; repair it now if the next argument depends on it. Reuse a familiar example to reconnect context when useful, then vary the feature that tests understanding. A fresh context helps distinguish reasoning from memorization, but novelty for its own sake wastes attention.

Thirty minutes is a guide to energy, not a coverage quota. A lesson may span sessions. At a natural boundary, use the learner's energy and requests to decide whether to continue; ask if unclear. Do not end a session unilaterally merely because the guideline elapsed.

### Close and persist

- Update progress judgments, evidence, misconceptions, and next-session pointers. Validate JSON. Separate what was taught from what the learner demonstrated.
- Write a short `sessions/<date>.md` log: what the session answered, consequential learner responses, tutor mistakes, and where to resume. Append distinct entries for multiple sessions on the same date.
- Tell the learner what they can now reason through, what remains open, and where the course goes next. Do not claim something clicked without evidence.
- If the course is within one unit of unresearched material, prepare it now using `references/create-course.md`. Keep current-practice material fresh using `references/freshness.md`.

## Monitoring understanding

Use `unassessed` when there is insufficient evidence; `shaky` for an observed confusion; `settling` for understanding with help or limited independent evidence; `solid` for explaining and applying the idea with its relevant limits. Record brief evidence and the support given. A revealing question or spontaneous correction can be evidence; a formal quiz is unnecessary. A delayed application can strengthen confidence that understanding persisted.

Choose revisits for their relevance and evidence, not to clear a backlog of everything delivered. In review mode, select important distinctions or prerequisites and approach them through comparison, explanation, or application. If gaps accumulate, suggest a focused review instead of crowding every lesson with checks.

## Curate and status

For curation, read `references/curate.md`. Inspect recent teaching and learner feedback, identify the failure, and revise the lesson design or course contract accordingly. A request for more depth may require better examples, reasoning, or lesson leadership, not simply more words or harder exercises.

For status, read each course's progress and report current lesson, completed lessons, approximate time, and the important open questions. Flag courses dormant for roughly three weeks as candidates for resuming, pausing, merging, or archiving. Record status changes only when the user chooses them.
